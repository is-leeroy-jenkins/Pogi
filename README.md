cd chismis
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook models.ipynb
```


## üî¨ Data Source

- The SF 133 Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources fulfills the requirement in 31 U.S.C. 1511 - 1514
- That is, the President reviews Federal expenditures at least four times a year.
- SF 133s provide historical reference that can be used to help prepare the President's Budget, program operating plans, and spend-out rate estimates.
- For further information on the SF 133 [here](https://tfx.treasury.gov/taxonomy/term/10991)
- Agencies submit the data that appear on these reports to the Department of the Treasury Bureau of Fiscal Service.
- While OMB publishes these reports, the underlying data is submitted by the agencies.
- File A (Account Balances) published monthly by agencies on [USASpending](https://www.usaspending.gov/federal_account)
- Required by the DATA Act.
- Pulled automatically from data in the [Governmentwide Treasury Account Symbol Adjusted Trial Balance System (GTAS)](https://fiscal.treasury.gov/gtas/)
- Contains Budgetary resources, obligation, and outlay data for all the relevant Treasury Account Symbols (TAS) in a reporting agency.
- It includes both award and non-award spending (grouped together), and crosswalks with the [SF 133 report](https://portal.max.gov/portal/document/SF133/Budget/FACTS%20II%20-%20SF%20133%20Report%20on%20Budget%20Execution%20and%20Budgetary%20Resources.html).
