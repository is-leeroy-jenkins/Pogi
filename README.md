## üî¨ Data Source

- The SF 133 Report on Budget Execution and Budgetary Resources fulfills the requirement in 31 U.S.C. 1511 - 1514
- That is, the President reviews Federal expenditures at least four times a year.
- SF 133s provide historical reference that can be used to help prepare the President's Budget, program operating plans, and spend-out rate estimates.
- For further information on the SF 133 from the US Treasury [here](https://tfx.treasury.gov/taxonomy/term/10991) 
- SF 133 inventory of reports from 1998 - 2025 can be found on OMB's MAX [here](https://portal.max.gov/portal/document/SF133/Budget/FACTS%20II%20-%20SF%20133%20Report%20on%20Budget%20Execution%20and%20Budgetary%20Resources.html)
- Agencies submit the data that appear on these reports to the Department of the Treasury Bureau of Fiscal Service.
- While OMB publishes these reports, the underlying data is submitted by the agencies.
- File A (Account Balances) published monthly by agencies on [USASpending](https://www.usaspending.gov/federal_account)
- Required by the DATA Act.
- Pulled automatically from data in the [Governmentwide Treasury Account Symbol Adjusted Trial Balance System (GTAS)](https://fiscal.treasury.gov/gtas/)
- Contains Budgetary resources, obligation, and outlay data for all the relevant Treasury Account Symbols (TAS) in a reporting agency.
- It includes both award and non-award spending (grouped together), and crosswalks with the [SF 133 report](https://portal.max.gov/portal/document/SF133/Budget/FACTS%20II%20-%20SF%20133%20Report%20on%20Budget%20Execution%20and%20Budgetary%20Resources.html).

| Statistic         | Description                             | Use in Budget Analysis                                               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mean**         | Average value                           | Avg. Outlays, Obligations, etc., across accounts                |
| **Median**       | Middle value                            | Robust central tendency in skewed financial data                    |
| **Mode**         | Most frequent value                     | Identify common MainAccountCodes or Availability categories     |
| **Standard Deviation** | Spread around the mean                | Indicates variability in execution rates or balances                |
| **Variance**     | Square of standard deviation            | Used in statistical tests and model diagnostics                     |
| **Range**        | Difference between max and min          | Measures total spread of financial metrics                          |
| **Interquartile Range (IQR)** | Spread of middle 50% of data           | Identifies budget outliers and extreme accounts                     |
| **Skewness**     | Asymmetry of distribution               | Skewed obligations suggest few accounts dominate totals             |
| **Kurtosis**     | "Peakedness" of distribution            | High values indicate outlier-prone financial data                   |

| **Pearson Correlation** | Linear relationship between variables                  | E.g., TotalResources vs. Obligations                                 |
| **Spearman Correlation**| Monotonic (rank-based) relationship                    | More robust to non-linear trends in financial execution              |
| **t-test**              | Compare means between 2 groups                         | Discretionary vs. Mandatory accounts' execution rates                |
| **ANOVA**               | Compare means across multiple groups                   | Obligations across availability periods or account types             |
| **Chi-square Test**     | Categorical independence                               | Are Main Account Codes related to availability or a specific agency? |
| **Confidence Intervals**| Estimate range of a population mean                    | Upper and lower bound expected obligations or recoveries             |
| **Regression Coefficients (p-values)** | Test variable significance                             | Are Recoveries a significant predictor of UnobligatedBalance?        |
| **F-statistic (overall regression)**   | Test whole model fit                                   | Determines the combined influence of all predictors                  |
| **Z-score / Outlier Tests** | Deviation from standard mean                           | Identify abnormal balances or lapse rates                            |
| **Boxplots**            | Visual outlier detection                               | Discover obligation anomalies within agencies                        |
